# Create-CertificateRequest.ps1
This script creates a new certificate request based on an inf file template. Hostnames used are gathered from Exchange virtual directory configurations.

##Description
The script queries Exchange Server 2013+ virtual directory hostnames to create a certificate request.
    
The request is created using an inf file template. You can prepare multiple template files to choose from. 
Template files are supposed to be stored in the same folder as this PowerShell script.

The inf file used to create the certificate request is stored on the same directory as the PowerShell script.

The script queries for the certificate's common name (CN).

If created, the certificate request is stored in the same directory as the PowerShell script.

The content of the certificate request file is the CSR to be submitted to a Certificate Authority.
